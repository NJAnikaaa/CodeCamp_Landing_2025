# CodeCamp_Landing_2025
CodeCamp Landing 2025 — A responsive landing page project showcasing modern web design practices. Built with HTML &amp; CSS.

Hi! This is my first website project. I'm so excited to share it with you! 😊

## What is this project?

This is a website for CodeCamp 2025, which is a coding bootcamp. I made this website using HTML and CSS. It's a practice project where I learned how to build a complete website from scratch!

## What I learned

While making this project, I learned:
- How to write HTML code
- How to style websites with CSS
- How to make websites look good on phones and tablets (responsive design)
- How to add navigation bars
- How to create card layouts
- How to make contact forms

## Files in this project

- `index.html` - This is the main HTML file with all the content
- `style.css` - This file has all the styling (colors, fonts, layouts)
- `responsive-media-queries.css` - This makes the website work on mobile phones and tablets
- `images/` - Folder with all the images I used


## Things I used

- **HTML5** - For the structure
- **CSS3** - For styling
- **Font Awesome** - For the social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
- **Google Fonts** - I used Segoe UI font family

## Problems I faced (and solved!)

- At first, my cards were not aligning properly. I fixed it using flexbox!
- The website looked bad on mobile. I learned about media queries and fixed it!
- The navigation menu was tricky. I used a select dropdown to make it simple.

## What I want to improve

I know this is not perfect, and that's okay! I'm still learning. Here are things I want to add later:
- Make the menu work properly (right now it's just a dropdown)
- Add JavaScript to make buttons actually do something
- Add more animations
- Make the contact form actually send emails

## Screenshots

(I didn't add screenshots yet, but I will learn how to do that next!)

## Contact Me

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to learn from others.

**Note:** This is a practice project I made while learning web development. Some images might not load if you don't have the image files in the correct folder.

Thank you for checking out my first web project!
